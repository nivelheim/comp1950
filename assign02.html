          <h2>Toronto</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The first city of Canada I had visited in my life. Not much things that
          I remember because it has been 10 years since then. The thing I liked about
          the place was Niagara Falls, which gives the chance to feel the majesty of nature.
          The thing I did not like was the weather. I visited place in August, which had the
          highest temperature of the day throught the year. Do not forget to visit Playland,
          the largest theme park in Canada!</p>

          <h2>New York</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The Second US city I have visited in my life. The historical structures and figurines
          standing among gigantic contemporal buildings provides tourists sensational feelings.
          The city also have selections of the world's famous restaurents (3 stars Michellin Guide restaurents)
          wihch you can rarely see in Vancouver. However neighbours and people were not as nice as people
          in Vancouver. </p>

        <div class="imgheader">
          <img src="images/seoul.jpg" alt="Seoul" />
          <h2>Seoul</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This is the city I was born and raised until 15. One of the populated city in the world.
          The city is changing constantly; The city I visited last year is completely different than
          city I visited 5 years ago. The city adapts to change of culture and technology
          in such a quick pace. People who put emphasis on maintaining traditions
          would not like the city, whereas it could be a heaven to younger people who
          enjoys eating, partying and fast-paced city environment.</p>

          <h2>HTML5 Tags</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The first HTML5 tag would be timg tag. The tag defines both
          a human-readable date/time.encode dates and times in a machine-readable
          way so that human can easily understand the format and machine can
          parse/fetch the data easily for any indexing purposes. </p><br>
        <p>This element is not appropriate for instances where a specific date cannot
           be calculated, nor should it be used for dates prior to the introduction
           to the Gregorian calendar (due to complications with calculating those dates).</p><br>
        <p>Supported in Chrome 6.0, IE 9.0, Firefox 4.0, Safari 5.0, Opera 11.1 or higher.</p><br>
        <p>Example: Tomorrow is the
          <time datetime="2017-06-05 13:00">First day of Second week's class</time>.</p><br><br><br>
        <p>The second HTML5 tag is the progress tag. The tag is used to represent the progress of a task.</p><br>
        <p>This element includes the global attributes.</p>
        <p>max: This attribute describes how much work the task indicated by the progress element requires.
           The max attribute must have a value greater than zero and be a valid floating point number.
           The default value is 1. </p>
        <p>value: This attribute specifies how much of the task that has been completed. It must be a valid
          floating point number between 0 and max, or between 0 and 1 if max is omitted. If there is no value attribute,
           the progress bar is indeterminate; this indicates that an activity is ongoing with no indication of
           how long it is expected to take.<p><br>
        <p>Supported in Chrome 9.0, IE 10.0, Firefox 16.0, Safari 6.0, Opera 11.0 or higher.</p><br>
        <p>Example: <progress value="70" max="100">70 %</progress></p><br>
